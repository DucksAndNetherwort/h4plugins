## **NEW**

* Event-driven programming model
    * dozens of new utility functions

  * Colored GPIO LED simulation
  * User Buttons
* Commands to create / manage LED flashing at run-time (config compiled out)
* Many new example sketches demonstrating new features / techniques now 85 examples
* "NODE-PINK" GPIO handling model, easily user-extended
* New Plugins
  * [H4P_AsyncHTTP](h4phttp.md)  - remote http access
  * Presence detection revamped , new :building_construction: [H4P_Gatekeeper](h4pgk.md) watches for
