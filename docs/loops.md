# H4P_EmitLoopCount

## Shortname evtq

Emits `H4PE_LOOPS` once per second. This gives a *very* rough estimate of the number of times per second that H4 is able to schedule its task queue.

In an unloaded ESP8266 clocked at 80MHz with an empty queue, this figure is typically 75000 - 85000. This allows a (*very*) rough comparison with how "busy" the current app is, and can be helpful in tracking down bugs, performance bottlenecks etc. Do not treat its absolute value nor meaning as particulalry scientific.

***N.B.*** This may require editing of [H4](https://github.com/philbowles/H4) configuration, because providing this facility is in itself a performance "hit" and is therfore usually "compiled out".
